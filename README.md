# Apple Game

## Rules

Two people are playing a game. From the pile of 25 apples, each player takes either 1, 2 or 3 apples on each turn. The game is over once all apples are taken. Whoever has the even amount of apples wins.

When you are ready to play, select the game mode and press start. After each pick, you will see the total amount of your apples.
